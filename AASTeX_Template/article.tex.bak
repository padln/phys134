Star clusters serve as fundamental laboratories for understanding stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. We present a comparative study of mass density profiles in two representative stellar systems: the globular cluster M2 and the open cluster M34. M2, located in Aquarius, is an ancient ($\sim$13 Gyr) and massive globular cluster with over 150,000 stars, while M34 in Perseus is a younger ($\sim$200 Myr) open cluster with several hundred members. This study develops a comprehensive observational methodology for deriving accurate density profiles, including signal-to-noise calculations for observation planning, completeness corrections using artificial star tests with maximum likelihood estimation, and rigorous membership determination combining color-magnitude diagram filtering, Gaia proper motion analysis, and spatial distribution modeling. We employ the Plummer model as a theoretical framework to characterize the density profiles of both clusters. The contrasting properties of these systems---age, mass, concentration, and dynamical state---make them ideal testbeds for understanding how stellar systems evolve and disperse over cosmic timescales. This work establishes the data reduction pipeline and statistical methodology necessary for future photometric analysis of these clusters.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Star clusters are gravitationally bound systems of stars that formed from the same giant molecular cloud, providing natural laboratories for studying stellar evolution, dynamical processes, and galactic structure. These systems can be broadly classified into two main types: globular clusters and open clusters, which differ dramatically in age, mass, stellar population, and dynamical state.

\subsection{Star Clusters as Astrophysical Laboratories}

Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Galaxy, with ages typically exceeding 10 billion years. They contain hundreds of thousands to millions of stars in compact, spherically symmetric configurations with high central densities. Their ancient stellar populations, low metallicities, and tight gravitational binding make them valuable probes of the early Galaxy and stellar evolution at low metallicity. In contrast, open clusters are younger systems, ranging from a few million to a few billion years old, containing tens to thousands of stars in loosely bound configurations. These clusters are found primarily in the Galactic disk and provide insights into recent star formation and the evolution of solar-metallicity stars.

The mass density profile---the distribution of stellar mass as a function of radius from the cluster center---is a fundamental property that encodes information about a cluster's formation, dynamical evolution, and ultimate fate. Measuring accurate density profiles requires addressing several observational challenges: photometric completeness at faint magnitudes, contamination from field stars, and the characterization of observational uncertainties.

\subsection{The Plummer Model}

The Plummer model, proposed by \citet{plummer1911} as a mathematical description of globular clusters, provides a simple yet physically motivated framework for characterizing spherical stellar systems. The model is defined by its gravitational potential:
\begin{equation}
\Phi(r) = -\frac{GM}{\sqrt{r^2 + a^2}}
\label{eq:plummer_potential}
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the total cluster mass, and $a$ is the Plummer radius, a scale parameter characterizing the size of the cluster core.

The corresponding mass density distribution can be derived from Poisson's equation, $\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho$. For a spherically symmetric system, this yields:
\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{3M}{4\pi a^3} \left(1 + \frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{-5/2}
\label{eq:plummer_density}
\end{equation}

This profile exhibits two key features: (1) a constant-density core as $r \to 0$, with $\rho(0) = 3M/(4\pi a^3)$, and (2) a steep power-law decline $\rho(r) \propto r^{-5}$ at large radii. While more sophisticated models (e.g., King, Wilson, and Michie-King models) better describe observed clusters by incorporating effects such as tidal truncation and anisotropic velocity dispersions, the Plummer model's analytical tractability makes it an excellent starting point for characterizing cluster structure.

\subsection{Our Target Clusters: M2 and M34}

We focus on two clusters that exemplify the extremes of the cluster population: M2 (NGC 7089), a massive globular cluster, and M34 (NGC 1039), a nearby open cluster.

\textbf{M2} is located in the constellation Aquarius at a distance of approximately 11.5 kpc. With an age of $\sim$12.5--13 Gyr and a metallicity of [Fe/H] $\approx -1.6$, it represents the ancient, metal-poor stellar population characteristic of the Galactic halo. M2 contains over 150,000 stars within a half-light radius of $\sim$6 arcmin and exhibits the highly concentrated, spherically symmetric structure typical of dynamically evolved globular clusters. Its high central density and steep density gradient make it well-suited for testing the Plummer model and more complex dynamical models.

\textbf{M34} is a young open cluster in Perseus, located at a distance of only $\sim$470 pc with an age of $\sim$200 Myr. It contains an estimated 100--400 members spread over a region $\sim$30 arcmin in diameter. Unlike M2, M34 has solar metallicity and a much lower stellar density, reflecting its recent formation and loose gravitational binding. The cluster's proximity to the Galactic plane results in significant field star contamination, making membership determination a critical component of the analysis. M34 is also more susceptible to tidal disruption from the Galactic potential, and its eventual dispersal is expected within a few hundred million years.

The stark contrasts between these systems---in age (13 Gyr vs. 200 Myr), mass ($\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ vs. $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$), density profile, and dynamical state---make them ideal comparative targets for understanding how stellar systems evolve and how observational techniques must be adapted to different astrophysical regimes.

\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}

Deriving accurate stellar density profiles from photometric observations requires careful attention to observational planning, data reduction, and systematic error mitigation. This section outlines our comprehensive methodology, which includes signal-to-noise calculations for exposure time optimization, photometric completeness corrections via artificial star tests, and multi-dimensional membership determination to isolate cluster members from field star contamination.

\subsection{Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Observation Planning} \label{subsec:snr}

Accurate photometry requires sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) across the magnitude range of interest. We calculate the expected S/N for point sources using the CCD equation \citep{howell2006}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{S}{N} = \frac{F A_\epsilon \tau}{\sqrt{N_R^2 + \tau (F A_\epsilon + i_{DC} + F_\beta A_\epsilon \Omega)}}
\label{eq:snr}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the target flux (photons s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$), $A_\epsilon$ is the effective collecting area of the telescope (m$^{2}$), $\tau$ is the integration time (s), $N_R$ is the readout noise (electrons), $i_{DC}$ is the dark current (electrons s$^{-1}$), $F_\beta$ is the sky background flux per solid angle (photons s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$), and $\Omega$ is the solid angle subtended by one pixel (sr).

The signal term, $S = F A_\epsilon \tau$, represents the total number of photons collected from the target star. The noise has four components: (1) readout noise $N_R$, a constant per exposure, (2) Poisson noise from the source itself $\sqrt{F A_\epsilon \tau}$, (3) dark current noise $\sqrt{i_{DC} \tau}$, and (4) sky background noise $\sqrt{F_\beta A_\epsilon \Omega \tau}$.

For multi-pixel aperture photometry, the effective noise scales with the number of pixels $n_{pix}$ over which the source is distributed. The readout and background noise terms scale as $\sqrt{n_{pix}}$, while the source signal and source noise remain unchanged (assuming the aperture captures all source flux). This leads to a modified S/N:
\begin{equation}
\frac{S}{N} = \frac{F A_\epsilon \tau}{\sqrt{F A_\epsilon \tau + n_{pix}(N_R^2 + i_{DC}\tau + F_\beta A_\epsilon \Omega \tau)}}
\label{eq:snr_multipix}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Image Stacking:} To improve S/N while avoiding saturation of bright stars, we employ image stacking. If $N_{exp}$ independent exposures of duration $\tau$ are combined, the stacked S/N increases as:
\begin{equation}
(S/N)_{\rm stacked} = \sqrt{N_{exp}} \times (S/N)_{\rm single}
\label{eq:snr_stack}
\end{equation}
This technique is particularly valuable for observations of M34, where the dynamic range from the brightest members (V $\sim$ 11 mag) to the faintest detectable stars (V $\sim$ 19 mag) spans nearly 8 magnitudes.

Using Equation \ref{eq:snr}, we planned multi-band SDSS $g'$ and $r'$ observations with exposure times optimized to achieve S/N $> 20$ at the faint limit while maintaining S/N $> 100$ for bright cluster members through shorter individual exposures combined via stacking.

\subsection{Completeness Corrections} \label{subsec:completeness}

Photometric surveys suffer from incompleteness at faint magnitudes due to detection limits, photometric uncertainties, and source crowding. The completeness function $C(m)$ is defined as the fraction of stars at true magnitude $m$ that are successfully detected and measured:
\begin{equation}
C(m) \equiv \frac{N_{\rm detected}(m)}{N_{\rm true}(m)}
\end{equation}

The observed luminosity function $\Phi_{\rm obs}(m)$ is related to the intrinsic luminosity function by:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\rm obs}(m) = C(m) \cdot \Phi_{\rm true}(m)
\label{eq:lf_completeness}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Artificial Star Tests}

We determine $C(m)$ empirically using artificial star tests. For each magnitude bin $m_i$, we inject $N_{\rm add}$ artificial stars with known positions $(x_j, y_j)$ and magnitudes into the science images, run the same photometric reduction pipeline, and measure the recovery fraction.

A star is considered "recovered" if a source is detected within a matching radius $r_{\rm match}$ (typically 1--2 pixels) and the recovered magnitude satisfies $|m_{\rm rec} - m_{\rm input}| < \Delta m_{\rm max}$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta r_{ij} = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j^{\rm rec})^2 + (y_i - y_j^{\rm rec})^2} < r_{\rm match}
\end{equation}

The completeness for magnitude bin $m_i$ is:
\begin{equation}
C(m_i) = \frac{N_{\rm recovered}(m_i)}{N_{\rm added}(m_i)}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}

Rather than using simple least-squares fitting, we employ maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with proper binomial statistics. The number of recovered stars follows a binomial distribution:
\begin{equation}
P(N_{\rm rec} | N_{\rm add}, C) = \binom{N_{\rm add}}{N_{\rm rec}} C^{N_{\rm rec}} (1 - C)^{N_{\rm add} - N_{\rm rec}}
\end{equation}

For a parametric completeness model $C(m; \theta)$, such as the error function model:
\begin{equation}
C(m; m_{50}, \sigma_{\rm comp}) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + {\rm erf}\left( \frac{m_{50} - m}{\sqrt{2} \sigma_{\rm comp}} \right) \right]
\label{eq:completeness_erf}
\end{equation}
where $m_{50}$ is the magnitude at 50\% completeness and $\sigma_{\rm comp}$ controls the steepness of the transition, the log-likelihood across all magnitude bins is:
\begin{equation}
\ln \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ N_{\rm rec,i} \ln C(m_i; \theta) + (N_{\rm add,i} - N_{\rm rec,i}) \ln (1 - C(m_i; \theta)) \right]
\label{eq:log_likelihood}
\end{equation}

We maximize Equation \ref{eq:log_likelihood} to obtain the best-fit parameters $\hat{\theta}_{\rm MLE}$. Parameter uncertainties are estimated from the Fisher information matrix:
\begin{equation}
F_{jk} = -\left\langle \frac{\partial^2 \ln \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_j \partial \theta_k} \right\rangle, \quad {\rm Cov}(\theta) = F^{-1}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution}

Simple division by $C(m)$ ignores photometric scatter, where stars at true magnitude $m'$ may be observed at $m \neq m'$ due to measurement uncertainty. The observed distribution is a convolution:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\rm obs}(m) = \int K(m, m') \Phi_{\rm true}(m') \, dm'
\end{equation}
where the kernel $K(m, m') = C(m') \cdot P(m | m')$ incorporates both completeness and photometric scatter, assumed to be Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
P(m | m') = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_m^2}} \exp\left[ -\frac{(m - m')^2}{2\sigma_m^2} \right]
\end{equation}

We apply the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, an iterative maximum-likelihood deconvolution method that enforces positivity. Starting from an initial guess $\Phi_{\rm true}^{(0)} = \Phi_{\rm obs}$, we iterate:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\rm true}^{(n+1)}(m') = \Phi_{\rm true}^{(n)}(m') \int \frac{\Phi_{\rm obs}(m)}{\int K(m, m'') \Phi_{\rm true}^{(n)}(m'') dm''} K(m, m') \, dm
\end{equation}
until convergence (typically 20--50 iterations).

\subsection{Membership Determination} \label{subsec:membership}

Both M2 and M34 lie in regions with significant field star contamination. Accurate density profiles require isolating cluster members from foreground and background stars. We employ a Bayesian approach combining three independent membership criteria: color-magnitude diagram (CMD) filtering, proper motion analysis, and spatial distribution.

\subsubsection{Color-Magnitude Diagram Filtering}

Cluster members share common properties: age, metallicity, distance, and reddening. In the CMD, they follow a well-defined isochrone. We compute the perpendicular distance from each star to a theoretical isochrone, normalized by photometric uncertainties:
\begin{equation}
d_{\rm CMD}(i) = \min_j \sqrt{\left(\frac{g_i - g_{\rm iso,j}}{\sigma_g}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{(g-r)_i - (g-r)_{\rm iso,j}}{\sigma_{g-r}}\right)^2}
\end{equation}

The CMD membership probability is modeled as:
\begin{equation}
P_{\rm CMD}(i) = \exp\left[ -\frac{d_{\rm CMD}^2(i)}{2} \right]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Proper Motion Filtering}

We use Gaia DR3 proper motions to separate cluster members, which exhibit coherent motion, from field stars with random velocities. The cluster proper motion distribution is modeled as a bivariate Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
P(\boldsymbol{\mu}_i | {\rm cluster}) = \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_i; \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\rm cl}, \Sigma_{\rm cl})
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\rm cl} = (\mu_{\alpha^*}, \mu_\delta)$ is the mean cluster proper motion and $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$ is the covariance matrix, determined via iterative sigma-clipping.

Including individual measurement uncertainties $\Sigma_{\rm obs,i}$, the total covariance is $\Sigma_{\rm total,i} = \Sigma_{\rm cl} + \Sigma_{\rm obs,i}$. The membership probability is:
\begin{equation}
P_{\rm PM}(i) = \frac{\mathcal{L}_{\rm cluster}(i)}{\mathcal{L}_{\rm cluster}(i) + \mathcal{L}_{\rm field}(i)}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm cluster}(i) = \frac{1}{2\pi |\Sigma_{\rm total,i}|^{1/2}} \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2} (\boldsymbol{\mu}_i - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\rm cl})^T \Sigma_{\rm total,i}^{-1} (\boldsymbol{\mu}_i - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\rm cl}) \right]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Spatial Distribution}

Cluster members follow a centrally concentrated radial profile (e.g., Plummer or King), while field stars are uniformly distributed. The spatial membership probability is:
\begin{equation}
P_{\rm spatial}(r) = \frac{\rho_{\rm cluster}(r)}{\rho_{\rm cluster}(r) + \Sigma_{\rm bg}}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm cluster}(r)$ is the assumed cluster profile and $\Sigma_{\rm bg}$ is the constant background surface density, estimated from the outermost observed regions.

\subsubsection{Combined Membership Probability}

Assuming the three criteria are statistically independent, we combine them using Bayes' theorem:
\begin{equation}
P_{\rm member}(i) = \frac{L_{\rm cluster}(i) \cdot P_{\rm prior}}{L_{\rm cluster}(i) \cdot P_{\rm prior} + L_{\rm field}(i) \cdot (1 - P_{\rm prior})}
\label{eq:combined_membership}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
L_{\rm cluster}(i) = P_{\rm CMD}(i) \times P_{\rm PM}(i) \times P_{\rm spatial}(i)
\end{equation}
and $L_{\rm field}(i)$ is similarly computed using field star models.

Stars with $P_{\rm member} > 0.5$ are classified as likely members, though the continuous probabilities are used to weight stars in the density profile construction, avoiding arbitrary hard cuts.

\section{Data Reduction Pipeline} \label{sec:pipeline}

The data reduction pipeline integrates the methodologies described in Section \ref{sec:methodology} into a systematic workflow:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Image Pre-processing:} Bias subtraction, dark current correction, and flat-fielding using standard CCD reduction techniques.

\item \textbf{Image Stacking:} Co-registration and median-combination of multiple exposures to improve S/N while rejecting cosmic rays and transient artifacts.

\item \textbf{Source Detection and Photometry:} Point-spread function (PSF) fitting photometry or aperture photometry, depending on crowding conditions. For M2's dense core, PSF photometry is essential.

\item \textbf{Astrometric Calibration:} Cross-matching with Gaia DR3 to establish accurate World Coordinate System (WCS) solutions.

\item \textbf{Photometric Calibration:} Calibration to standard SDSS magnitudes using comparison stars with known photometry.

\item \textbf{Artificial Star Tests:} Implementation of completeness corrections as described in Section \ref{subsec:completeness}.

\item \textbf{Membership Determination:} Application of CMD, proper motion, and spatial filters (Section \ref{subsec:membership}) to assign membership probabilities to all detected sources.

\item \textbf{Radial Profile Construction:} Binning of member stars by angular distance from the cluster center, with appropriate completeness and background corrections applied to each radial bin.

\item \textbf{Model Fitting:} Least-squares or maximum-likelihood fitting of Plummer profiles (and potentially King or Wilson profiles) to the corrected surface density data.
\end{enumerate}

This pipeline will be implemented using a combination of standard astronomical software packages (e.g., IRAF, AstroPy, Photutils) and custom Python scripts for the statistical analyses.

\section{Observations and Data} \label{sec:data}

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

We have developed a comprehensive observational and statistical framework for measuring mass density profiles in star clusters, demonstrated through its application to the globular cluster M2 and the open cluster M34. Our methodology incorporates rigorous signal-to-noise calculations for observation planning, artificial star tests with maximum likelihood estimation for completeness corrections, and multi-dimensional Bayesian membership determination combining photometric, astrometric, and spatial information.

The stark differences between M2 and M34---spanning orders of magnitude in age, mass, and density---provide an ideal testbed for understanding the full range of cluster properties and evolutionary states. The data reduction pipeline and statistical methods established here are applicable to other stellar systems and will enable systematic studies of cluster populations across the Galaxy.

\textit{[Additional conclusions will be added following the completion of the data analysis.]} 

Tables longer than 200 data lines and complex tables should only have a short example table with the full data set available in the machine readable format.  The machine readable table will be available in the HTML version of the article with just a short example in the PDF. Authors are required to indicate in the table comments that the data is in machine readable format in the full article.  Authors are encouraged to create their own machine readable tables using the online tool at \url{http://authortools.aas.org/MRT/upload.html}.

\aastex\ v6 introduced five new table features that were designed to make
table construction easier and the resulting display better for AAS Journal
authors. The items are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Declaring math mode in specific columns,
\item Column decimal alignment, 
\item Automatic column header numbering,
\item Hiding columns, and
\item Splitting wide tables into two or three parts.
\end{enumerate}

Full details on how to create each of these special table types are given in the guidelines at \url{http://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex.html}.

\subsubsection{Extremely wide tables}

Since the AAS Journals are now all electronic with no print version there is no reason why tables can not be as wide as authors need them to be. For wide tables, the full table will almost always be available in machine readable format with just an example in the article but how is an example created for a wide table?

There are two ways to create examples for wide tabular data sets. The first is to to break a table into two or three components so that it flows down a page by invoking a new table type, splittabular or splitdeluxetable. Within these tables a new ``B'' column separator is introduced.  Much like the vertical bar option, ``$\vert$'', that produces a vertical table lines the new ``B'' separator indicates where to \underline{B}reak a table.  Up to two ``B''s may be included.

Table 1 shows how to split a wide deluxetable into three parts with
the {\tt\string\splitdeluxetable} command.  The {\tt\string\colnumbers}
option is on to show how the automatic column numbering carries through the
second table component.

\tablecomments{This is an example of how to split a deluxetable. You can
split any table with this command into two or three parts.  The location of
the split is given by the author based on the placement of the ``B''
indicators in the column identifier preamble.  For more information please
look at the new \aastex\ instructions.}
\end{splitdeluxetable*}

The second way is to create a "descriptive" table instead. This type of table only provides information about the columns rather than the data itself. Table 2 shows an example of this type of table using the same columns as in Table 1. Since these types of tables always have a machine readable component, this table uses the {\tt\string \digitalasset}\ command to highlight this fact.

\end{deluxetable*}

\subsection{Figures\label{subsec:figures}}

Authors can include a wide number of different graphics with their articles.
These range from general figures all authors are familiar with
to new enhanced graphics that can only be fully experienced in HTML.  The
later include figure sets, animations and interactive figures.  All
enhanced graphics require a static two dimensional representation in the
manuscript to serve as the example for the reader. All figures should
include detailed and descriptive captions.  These captions are absolutely
critical for readers for whom the enhanced figure is inaccessible either
due to a disability or offline access.  This portion of the article
provides examples for setting up all these types in with the latest version
of \aastex.

\subsection{General figures\label{subsec:general}}

\aastex\ has a {\tt\string\plotone} command to display a figure consisting
of one figure file.  Figure \ref{fig:general} is an example which shows
how AAS Publishing spends author publication charges. For a general figure
consisting of two figure files the {\tt\string\plottwo} command can be
used to position the two image files side by side.

Both {\tt\string\plotone} and {\tt\string\plottwo} take a
{\tt\string\caption} and an optional {\tt\string\figurenum} command to
specify the figure number\footnote{It is better to not use
{\tt\string\figurenum} and let \latex\ auto-increment all the figures. If you
do use this command you need to mark all of them accordingly.}.  Each is
based on the {\tt\string graphicx} package command,
{\tt\string\includegraphics}.  Authors are welcome to use
{\tt\string\includegraphics} along with its optional arguments that control
the height, width, scale, and position angle of a file within the figure.
More information on the full usage of {\tt\string\includegraphics} can be
found at \break
\url{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing\_Graphics\#Including\_graphics}.

\subsection{Enhanced graphics}

Enhanced graphics have an example figure to serve as an example for the
reader and the full graphical item available in the published HTML article.
This includes Figure sets, animations, and interactive figures. The 
Astronomy Image Explorer (\url{http://www.astroexplorer.org/}) provides 
access to all the figures published in the AAS Journals since they offered
an electronic version which was in the mid 1990s. You can filter image
searches by specific terms, year, journal, or type. The type filter is 
particularly useful for finding all published enhanced graphics. As of
August 2024 there are over 5600 videos, 2200 figure sets, and 200 interactive
figures. The next sections describe how to include these types of graphics
in your own manuscripts.

\section{Revision tracking and color highlighting} \label{sec:highlight}

The {\tt\string\added\{<text>\}} command should be used to highlight new text in bold for revised manuscripts. To activate this command, the {\tt\string trackchanges} option must be used in the {\tt\string\documentclass} call.  When compiled this will produce the marked text in bold font. Take out the {\tt\string trackchanges} option if you want the bold to disappear.

\added{This text was specifically added to feature this reborn functionality. Notice how the bold goes away when you remove the 'trackfeatures' option.}

\section{Software and third party data repository citations} \label{sec:cite}

The AAS Journals would like to encourage authors to change software and
third party data repository references from the current standard of a
footnote to a first class citation in the bibliography.  As a bibliographic
citation these important references will be more easily captured and credit
will be given to the appropriate people.

The first step to making this happen is to have the data or software in
a long term repository that has made these items available via a persistent
identifier like a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).  A list of repositories
that satisfy this criteria plus each one's pros and cons are given at \break
\url{https://github.com/AASJournals/Tutorials/tree/master/Repositories}.

In the bibliography the format for data or code follows this format: \\

\noindent author year, title, version, publisher, prefix:identifier\\

\citet{2015ApJ...805...23C} provides a example of how the citation in the
article references the external code at
\doi{10.5281/zenodo.15991}.  Unfortunately, bibtex does
not have specific bibtex entries for these types of references so the
``@misc'' type should be used.  The Repository tutorial explains how to
code the ``@misc'' type correctly.  The most recent .bst file, aasjournalv7.bst, will output bibtex ``@misc'' type properly.

Authors can also use the website \url{https://www.doi2bib.org/} to create a BIBTeX entry for any DOI. Please check the output from this site carefully as its output is only as good as the DOI metadata. Some DOI creators do not provide enough metadata to construct an adequate citation.

\appendix

\section{Appendix information}

Appendices can be broken into separate sections just like in the main text.
The only difference is that each appendix section is indexed by a letter
(A, B, C, etc.) instead of a number.  Likewise numbered equations have
the section letter appended.  Here is an equation as an example.
\begin{equation}
I = \frac{1}{1 + d_{1}^{P (1 + d_{2} )}}
\end{equation}
Appendix tables and figures should not be numbered like equations. Instead
they should continue the sequence from the main article body.

\section{Author publication charges} \label{sec:pubcharge}

In April 2011 the traditional way of calculating author charges based on 
the number of printed pages was changed.  The reason for the change
was due to a recognition of the growing number of article items that could not 
be represented in print. Now author charges are determined by a number of
digital ``quanta''.  A single quantum is defined as 350 words, one figure, one table,
and one digital asset.  For the latter this includes machine readable
tables, data behind a figure, figure sets, animations, and interactive figures.  The current cost
for the different quanta types is available at 
\url{https://journals.aas.org/article-charges-and-copyright/#author_publication_charges}. 
Authors may use the ApJL length calculator to get a {\tt rough} estimate of 
the number of word and float quanta in their manuscript. The calculator 
is located at \url{https://authortools.aas.org/ApJL/betacountwords.html}.

\section{Rotating tables} \label{sec:rotate}

To place a single page table in a landscape mode start the table portion with {\tt\string\begin\{rotatetable\}} and end with {\tt\string\end\{rotatetable\}}.

Tables that exceed a print page take a slightly different environment since both rotation and long table printing are required. In these cases start with {\tt\string\begin\{longrotatetable\}} and end with {\tt\string\end\{longrotatetable\}}. The {\tt\string\movetabledown} command can be used to help center extremely wide, landscape tables. The command {\tt\string\movetabledown=1in} will move any rotated table down 1 inch. 

A handy "cheat sheet" that provides the necessary \latex\ to produce 17
different types of tables is available at \url{http://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex/aasguide.html#table_cheat_sheet}.

\section{Using Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters}

Authors have the option to include names in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (CJK)
characters in addition to the English name. The names will be displayed
in parentheses after the English name. The way to do this in AASTeX is to
use the CJK package available at \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/cjk?lang=en}.

please go to \url{https://journals.aas.org/nonroman/}.
